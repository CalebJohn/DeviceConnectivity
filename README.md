## First time setup
A functioning python 3 installation is required before continuing, anything will do but I recommend the [Anaconda version](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) of python 3. Anaconda is just a regular python install that comes with a large number of python libraries, and a system for installing libraries that are often difficult to install with pip.

## Requirements
The requirements can be install with pip using

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

note: I used the [pipreqs tool](https://github.com/bndr/pipreqs) to generate the requirements file

## Adding new devices
